After working with .NET on web and Windows projects for 4 years in Belgium, I'm now living in Copenhagen (Denmark) and working as a mobile developer.
Previously I did Android development at [Endomondo](http://www.endomondo.com), but now I'm working on different mobile platforms at [Drivr](http://www.drivr.com).
I have also worked on the official [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) apps for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duckduckgo.mobile.android) and [Windows 8](http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/app/duckduckgo/d526ba1b-a065-4cb9-a6c6-bf30f6123e2b).
