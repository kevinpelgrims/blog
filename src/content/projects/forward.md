Forward was an online community where you would gather donations for your favorite charity by giving stuff away.

Building Forward was a fun and challenging experience.
From a mobile development perspective it was not that tough, but it required massive marketing efforts to build a network big enough to sustain a marketplace.
We made marketing material for the web, flyers on paper, joined forces with the Danish Red Cross and Mødrehjælpen, collaborated with Denmark's biggest football club FC København, etc.

## From the website

#### Give stuff

Take a picture of the thing you want to give away. People can request it as soon as it's up on Forward, and once you approve their request, their contribution will go to the charity of your choice.

#### Get stuff

You can browse Forward to find good stuff. When you find something you want, simply press the button to donate a small amount to charity, and pick up your item afterwards.

#### Donate to charity

With Forward, you pay for things by donating to charity. You get stuff you want, and you do good while doing it. It's a win-win.

#### Introducing Forward.

You don't need to throw away your good, old items anymore. With Forward, you can easily give them away. The people receiving them will donate a small amount of money to a charity of your choice.

To get started, all you have to do is take a picture of the item you would like to give away, put a price on it, and pick a charity from the list.

You can get rid of your stuff, people get things in good condition that are almost free, and charity organizations get extra help. Everybody wins!

## Television feature

Forward even made it to Danish national television!
