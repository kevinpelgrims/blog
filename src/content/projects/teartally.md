TearTally came into existence after a conversation with a friend who was keeping track of when they cry in a spreadsheet.
They wanted easier entry on the go and more features to analyze their emotional behavior.
Conveniently, this friend is also a designer and quickly mocked up some ideas for a mobile app, and I have some experience with mobile development.
We started building a prototype in Flutter (to reach both Android and iOS), while making use of several features in Firebase (to avoid setting up a backend from scratch).
This soon turned into a proper application that is currently (as of January 2026) in closed beta!
