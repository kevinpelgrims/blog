I am Kevin Pelgrims, a Copenhagen-based tech enthusiast.
I have been working in software engineering for around 20 years, working with many different technologies, and including 5+ years in leadership roles.
I currently work on technology for healthcare at [Corti](https://www.corti.ai/) and always do a little bit of hacking at home.

I wrote [a book on the Gradle build system for Android]({{ "books.md" | inputPathToUrl }}) in 2015,
and for 8 years I was a co-organizer and a regular speaker at the Android developers group in Copenhagen (DroidDevs-CPH), until it died out in 2020.

The last few years, I have been writing less code professionally (making up for that at home) and instead focus on leading teams to deliver user-friendly solutions to complex problems.
<br>
I have most recently worked on Android (Kotlin, Flutter), web (classic HTML and CSS, TypeScript, React), backend (Node, Kotlin), machine learning (Python), and architecture (cloud, micro services, API).
In the past I also worked with .NET (C#), iOS (Swift), and more.
Having worked with all these different technologies, I like to pick the right tool for the job.

When I'm not working with the team or on a side project, I'm most likely training for my next triathlon or recording and mixing music.
