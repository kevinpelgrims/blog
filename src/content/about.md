Software engineering manager with over 15 years of experience in software development, including 5+ years of mentorship and management.
I am enthusiastic about leading cross-functional teams to deliver user-friendly solutions to complex pronlems.

I have recently worked on Android (Kotlin, Flutter), web (classic HTML and CSS, TypeScript, React), backend (Node, Kotlin), machine learning (Python), and architecture (cloud, micro services, API).
In the past I also worked with .NET (C#), iOS (Swift), and more.
Having worked with all these different technologies, I like to pick the right tool for the job.

I'm a co-organizer and a regular speaker at the [Android developers group in Copenhagen](https://www.meetup.com/DroidDevs-CPH/).

When I'm not working with the team or on a side project, I'm most likely training for my next triathlon or recording and mixing music.
