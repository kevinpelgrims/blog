I wrote a book titled "Gradle for Android", which was released in July 2015. My main motivation for writing it was to help Android developers understand how Gradle works, how to get more out of the build system, and how to create tasks and plugins to automate the entire process. There is a great deal of information on build variants, dependency management, multi-module builds, testing, continuous integration, and more.

You can read more about the book on [Packt's website](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/gradle-android "Gradle for Android - Packt Publishing") or on [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1783986824/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1783986824&linkCode=as2&tag=kevpelblo-20&linkId=4SC63BNQEBHIDPVH "Gradle for Android - Amazon").
