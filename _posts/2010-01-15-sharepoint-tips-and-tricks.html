<p>Recently I added a webpart to a page in Sharepoint with some bad code in it. As a result I wasn't able to load the page anymore. The only thing I had to do was remove the webpart, so I found this little trick. If you add <strong>?Contents=1</strong> to the end of the URL of the page containing the webpart it displays the Webpart Page Maintenance page. Here you can remove the bad webpart.</p>

<p>An example of a URL: <strong>http://moss/default.aspx?contents=1</strong></p>

<p>After that I decided to collect some tricks and add them here,  so here is a small list of links to useful Sharepoint resources.</p>

Uses jQuery and some other JavaScript files. Very cool.</dd> <dt><a href="http://officetoolbox.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">http://officetoolbox.codeplex.com/</a></dt> <dd>Form settings is a nice feature to completely <strong>hide certain fields</strong> in forms, without writing code. Integrates with Sharepoint nicely.</dd> <dt><a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/naijacoder/archive/2007/09/23/115552.aspx" target="_blank">http://geekswithblogs.net/naijacoder/archive/2007/09/23/115552.aspx</a></dt> <dd>When you create <strong>webpartpages the navigation on the left side is gone</strong>.
