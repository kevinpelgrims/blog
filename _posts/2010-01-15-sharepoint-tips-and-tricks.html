Recently I added a webpart to a page in Sharepoint with some bad code in it. As a result I wasn't able to load the page anymore. The only thing I had to do was remove the webpart, so I found this little trick. If you addÂ <strong>?Contents=1</strong> to the end of the URL of the page containing the webpart it displays the Webpart Page Maintenance page. Here you can remove the bad webpart.

An example of a URL: **http://moss/default.aspx?contents=1**

After that I decided to collect some tricks and add them here, so here is a small list of links to useful Sharepoint resources.

  <br />
  Sharepoint 2007 **URL Quick List**, containing a list of commonly used Sharepoint URLs (like the one above).
* [http://sharepointjavascript.wordpress.com/2009/09/20/showing-or-hiding-list-fields-based-on-membership-in-a-sharepoint-group/](http://sharepointjavascript.wordpress.com/2009/09/20/showing-or-hiding-list-fields-based-on-membership-in-a-sharepoint-group/)
  <br />
  This one was very useful for **hiding fields** in a form based on the group a user was (not) in. Uses jQuery and some other JavaScript files. Very cool.

  <br />
  Form settings is a nice feature to completely **hide certain fields** in forms, without writing code. Integrates with Sharepoint nicely.

  <br />
  When you create **webpartpages the navigation on the left side is gone**. Using Sharepoint Designer this can easily be fixed.

  Very good post on **customizing** the results of **people search** in MOSS.

  <br />
  If you have to migrate data from SQL Server to Sharepoint lists or vice versa and you can use **Integration Services**, this will be very useful. It adds a Sharepoint list source and destination to the toolbox of Business Intelligence Development Studio.

  Everything you need to know about **Business Data Catalog**. Great starting guide.

  Very good starting guide on using **Reporting Services** in Sharepoint.
