<p>I had a few people asking me how I managed to format the source code for my PowerShell posts, so here's a short explanation.
Just type (or paste) your post and when it's time to insert the source code, switch to HTML view.</p>

There you can insert these tags:
<pre class="prettyprint">
[sourcecode language="csharp"]
somecode
[/sourcecode]
</pre>

And it will come out like this:

<pre class="prettyprint">
if(formatting)
{
  return &quot;Yay!&quot;;
}
</pre>

Yes, that's all there is to it.

There are actually quite a few languages that are supported. You can see the full list and an explanation on some extra parameters on this official WordPress page: <a href="http://en.support.wordpress.com/code/posting-source-code/">http://en.support.wordpress.com/code/posting-source-code/</a>
