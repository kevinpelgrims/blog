<p>On the Sharepoint project I am currently working on I use Nintex Workflow for approval workflows. Â There is this one list with lots of columns, some of which are irrelevant for certain approvers. So I needed to find a way to hide certain fields from the approver in the approval form (= task form). I googled this a bit, and the solution is actually pretty simple. All you need to do is create a view on the list, called "Workflow Task View", select the columns you want to be visible and you're done!</p>

<p>Yes, it's that simple :)</p>
